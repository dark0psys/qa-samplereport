# Bug Report: Items Duplicated When Player Leaves During Auto-Save Sequence

Severity: Critical  
**Category:** Gameplay / Economy  

**Environment:**  
- Platform: PC / Mobile  
- Version/Build: 1.4.1
- Server type: Public  

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Collect multiple items in-game (wood log (2x), wooden sword (1x), and apple (3x) were used here).  
2. Trigger an auto-save event (in this case, we advanced to the cherry biome as we levelled up).  
3. During the auto-save countdown or in-progress save, close Roblox immediately.  
4. Rejoin the server and check the inventory and progress logs.  

## Expected Result
- Inventory should reflect only items collected once.  
- Auto-save should either complete successfully or roll back safely if interrupted.  
- No duplication or loss of items occurs.  

## Actual Result
- Items collected just before leaving are sometimes **duplicated**, appearing 2–3 times (we ended up with 3 times more of each item)
- Quest progress may incorrectly mark objectives as complete multiple times.  
- Inventory UI sometimes shows temporary inconsistencies until a full reload.  
- Server logs indicate repeated "item add" calls during interrupted auto-save.  

## Frequency
Intermittent (~40% of attempts), more likely when leaving during the final 3–5 seconds of auto-save (20 attempts -> dupe worked 8 times).

## Attachments
- Screenshot of inventory showing duplicate items after reconnect  
- Screen recording of leaving mid-auto-save and reconnecting  
- Server log snippet showing repeated item addition  
- Optional: Crash report / client log  

## Additional Notes
- This issue has **high exploit potential**, especially for valuable or rare items.  
- More severe on Mobile clients due to slower network acknowledgment of save events.  
- Likely regression from v1.3.5 where auto-save was refactored to asynchronous saves.  
- Can impact leaderboards or economy if not fixed.  

## Related Systems
- Auto-save / checkpoint system  
- Inventory management backend  
- Network synchronization module  
- Quest progress tracker  

## Possible Cause (Optional)
- Race condition where interrupted auto-save triggers multiple backend calls for the same items.  
- Save confirmation not properly atomic; leaving mid-save allows duplicate write operations.  

## Whether this is Regression (Optional)
Yes, not present in v1.3.4; introduced in v1.3.5 async save refactor.
