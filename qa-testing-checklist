--QA Testing Checklist--

A generalized checklist I use to ensure thorough coverage across UI, gameplay, systems, and edge cases.
This list adapts depending on the project type.

1. Gameplay Consistency
- Core loop behaves as intended
- No actions trigger out-of-order sequences
- Progression systems behave consistently across sessions
- No unintended shortcuts or sequence breaks
- No soft-locks or progression blockers

2. UI & UX
- All buttons respond properly
- Hitboxes are correct
- No overlapping text, misalignment, or clipping
- All UI scales correctly for different screens
- Menus open/close correctly
- UI updates when values change
- Incorrect states revert properly

3. Economy & Currency Systems
- Purchases deduct correct amounts
- Rewards grant correct values
- No duplication or exploit patterns
- Timers, multipliers, bonuses update correctly
- Cross-feature interactions don’t inflate value
- Shop bundles display correct contents

4. Monetization Systems
- Purchase buttons behave as intended
- Products match Roblox developer product IDs
- Confirm/cancel works for each prompt
- UI cannot accidentally be double-purchased
- No free-granting premium content from UI bugs

5. Collision & Movement
- No fall-through-floor areas
- Wall collisions behave consistently
- Vehicle/character movement has no unintended speed boosts
- Jumping/steering mechanics behave within expected bounds

6. Input Testing
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Controller [I can test on both an XBOX or PlayStation Series to ensure console bugs are voided]
- Mobile touch
- Movement + action simultaneously
- Holding vs tapping behavior

7. Performance
- Stable FPS in all scenes
- No memory buildup
- No frame hitching when switching screens
- Asset loading happens smoothly

8. Audio
- Volumes consistent
- No looping issues
- Audio follows the correct objects

9. Visual / VFX
- No flickering
- No clipping
- No partially loaded models
- No repeating VFX appearing outside intended UI frames
- Transparency and layering consistent

10. Edge Cases / STRESS TESTING
- Sudden disconnects
- Rejoining mid-progress
- Spamming buttons
- Rapid purchase attempts
- Interruption mid-animation
- Leaving & rejoining during auto-savesaves

11. Regression Testing

Before confirming a fix:
- Verify the reported bug no longer occurs
- Verify related systems still function correctly
- Test old scenarios + new edge cases
- Test with different devices/platforms
